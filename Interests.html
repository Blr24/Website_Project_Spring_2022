The privatization of space has allowed for rapid advancement in such a short period of time, that the industry will look nothing like it does now 10, 20, or 40+ years down the road.

                            <p class="card-text">The music industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, responsible for continuously shaping and changing everything from pop culture, society, and even politics. You'd think with this much money flowing through that artists would all own super yachts or their own private island - or at least be able to make and release the music they and their fans love. Nope! This isn't always the case. There's so much bureaucracy, shade, and bad business that even the most talented artists get rinsed and hung out to dry. Keeping up with trends in the music industry and technologies and personalities with the potential to change the game is a real passion of mine!

                            <h5 class="card-title">Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Now that the United States Department of Defense has formally acknowledged the existence of, and its longtime interest in, unidentified flying objects with the leaking of the "tic-tac" video, UFOs have undergone a rebrand to UAPs and efforts to track and study these objects are being brought to the light. Early last year, Congress requested the creation of a comprehensive report on all that the DoD knows about UAPs. The report, delivered in June 2021, revealed that UAP sightings have long been recorded and monitored by various branches of the military and that of these sightings, a sizeable number cannot be explained. This represented a turning point in how we think about a subject that for many has always been a joke to be taken without credence. From here on out, it is anticipated that more information will steadily come out about what the DoD knows - and doesn't know. If you're new to the subject, give the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf">Preliminary Assessment</a> a read.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While growing at a very rapid pace, the mention of cryptocurrency draws many a blank stare and can be a conversation ender. But, there's actually much more to Ethereum, hbar, and the like than shiny digital coins people store in their little digital wallets. Cryptocurrencies are the currencies that power networks which will transform the world we live in and how we engage with technology and each other within the coming years. dApps, or decentralized applications, will power our daily lives and hold the promise to empower individuals by giving us a level of control over our digital existence and footprint not possible with current centralized technologies.
